      <h2>Our Story</h2>
      <p>
        From humble beginnings in the heart of <strong>Makrana, Rajasthan</strong>, Vishvakarma Furniture has grown from a one-man workshop to a trusted name in quality furniture. Built on passion, patience, and perfection — we believe furniture isn't just wood and polish; it's a reflection of your lifestyle.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>"Shuruaat chhoti thi, par iraade bade the."</em> From crafting small wooden stools to now designing custom-made living room sets, our journey has been one of learning and legacy.

        With decades of experience and a team of skilled artisans, we combine traditional Rajasthani craftsmanship with modern trends to deliver furniture that lasts generations.
